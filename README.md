## How the Lottery System Works

### Ticket IDs
- **Wheel Ticket**: ID 0 - Represents a generic lottery ticket used for spins.
- **Zodiac Sign - Bonus Ticket**: IDs 1 to 12 - Represents different zodiac sign boosters.
- **Winning Undistributed Ticket**: ID 13 - Represents a ticket that has won but the prize is yet to be revealed.

### Prize Tiers
- **Prize 1**: ID 14 - Highest tier prize.
- **Prize 2**: ID 15
- **Prize 3**: ID 16
- **Prize 4**: ID 17
- **Prize 5**: ID 18 - Lowest tier prize.

### User Interaction Flow

#### Buying Tickets

Users buy lottery tickets by calling the `createTicket` function and sending the appropriate amount of ETH (0.01 ETH per ticket).

**Function**: `createTicket(uint256 _amount)`
- **Parameters**:
  - `_amount`: Number of tickets to create.
  - **ETH Value**: `_amount * 0.01 ether`.

#### Spinning the Wheel

Users can spin the wheel for a chance to win a prize using their tickets by calling the `launchSpin` function.

**Function**: `launchSpin(uint256 _zodiakChoice, uint256 _poolId)`
- **Parameters**:
  - `_zodiakChoice`: ID of the zodiac booster in case of loss (Valid IDs: 1-12 for Zodiac Signs).
  - `_poolId`: ID of the pool in which the wheel is spun.

The result of the spin determines whether the user wins or loses:

- If the user wins, their ticket (ID 0) is transformed into a Winning Undistributed Ticket (ID 13).
- If the user loses, their ticket is transformed into the chosen zodiac booster (IDs 1-12).

#### Claiming Prizes

Winning ticket holders can reveal and claim their prizes by calling the `launchReveal` function.

**Function**: `launchReveal(uint256 _poolId)`
- **Parameters**:
  - `_poolId`: ID of the pool from which to reveal the prize ticket.

During the reveal process:

- The system uses Chainlink VRF to determine the prize tier.
- The Winning Undistributed Ticket (ID 13) is transformed into one of the prize tickets:
  - Prize 1: ID 14.
  - Prize 2: ID 15.
  - Prize 3: ID 16.
  - Prize 4: ID 17.
  - Prize 5: ID 18.

### Admin Interaction Flow

#### Setting Overseers

Admin can set overseer addresses to manage the lottery system by calling the `setOverseers` function.

**Function**: `setOverseers(address[] memory _overseers)`
- **Parameters**:
  - `_overseers`: Array of overseer addresses.

#### Creating a New Pool

Admin creates a new lottery pool by calling the `createPool` function.

**Function**: `createPool()`
- **Returns**: `uint256` - ID of the new pool.

#### Modifying Pool Duration

Admin modifies the duration for all pools by calling the `modifyAllPoolDuration` function.

**Function**: `modifyAllPoolDuration(uint256 _newDuration)`
- **Parameters**:
  - `_newDuration`: New duration for all pools.

#### Tallying Pools

Admin or overseer tallies the pools that have ended to determine winners by calling the `upkeepTallyPool` function.

**Function**: `upkeepTallyPool()`

#### Closing Pools

Admin or overseer closes pools after the claim period ends by calling the `upkeepClosePool` function.

**Function**: `upkeepClosePool()`

## Detailed Lottery Mechanics

### Winning vs. Losing Tickets

- **Winning Tickets**: When the wheel is spun, if the user wins, their Wheel Ticket (ID 0) is transformed into a Winning Undistributed Ticket (ID 13).
- **Losing Tickets**: When the wheel is spun and the user loses, the Wheel Ticket (ID 0) is transformed into the user's chosen zodiac booster (IDs 1-12).

### Prize Tickets

When a user with a Winning Undistributed Ticket (ID 13) reveals their prize by calling `launchReveal`:

**Function**: `launchReveal(uint256 _poolId)`
- **Parameters**:
  - `_poolId`: ID of the pool from which to reveal the prize ticket.

The reveal process uses Chainlink VRF to determine which prize the user wins. The prize tiers are as follows:

- **Prize 1**: ID 14.
- **Prize 2**: ID 15.
- **Prize 3**: ID 16.
- **Prize 4**: ID 17.
- **Prize 5**: ID 18.

The prize amounts are dynamically calculated based on the pool's pot and the number of winning tickets. Once the prize is determined, the Winning Undistributed Ticket (ID 13) is transformed into the corresponding prize ticket.

### Prize Distribution

- Prize tiers and amounts are dynamically calculated when a pool is tallied.
- The pool's pot is distributed among various prize tiers after deducting a fee.

### Chainlink VRF and Keepers

- **Chainlink VRF**: Ensures randomness in the lottery outcomes.
- **Chainlink Keepers**: Automate the tallying and closing of pools, providing reliable and timely operations without manual intervention.
